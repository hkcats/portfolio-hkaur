# Assignment 1

Gonna be the best first assignment ever!


## Prep

### Possible Ideas/Topics

- generative AI - insta using AI for search results
- location tracking - snapmap; facebook location posting
- Twitter -> X thoughts?
- impact of social media on mental health??
- **how does using the app impact the rest of the day?**

I would like to investigate the impact of using social media apps on the rest of the user's day. Broadly, any impacts on their mental health, mood, or even if they remember everything they see.

### Who to Interview
- ~~college students~~
- diverse range of amount of social media use
- **diverse ages/generations**
- diverse range of jobs - some jobs require social media use, some ban it, etc.

For me right now, the best 2 people I can interview are a 14 year old boy and a 49 year old woman, to represent a diverse age/generation range. Considering one is 1/2 a generation below me, and the other is a whole generation above me, I would say this encompasses very different views towards social media than myself.

### Starter Questions
- brief notes on paper, type up more details immediately after interview so i don't forget anything

- introduce social media as a general topic
- ask about some apps they might generally use 
    - how did they get the app? what convinced them to get it/keep it?
- how often do they use it? (per day?)
- when do they use it? certain time of day, certain mood theyre in
- how does it feel when/after they use it? 
- what sort of things get their attention? (if they're ok sharing)
- what sort of things do they randomly remember throughout the day? (uh, maybe phrase this so it's not as leading - maybe they don't remember anything at all)


## Interview Notes

### Interviewee A (49F)
- uses facebook and tiktok (mainly talked about facebook use, didn't get to tiktok at all :/)
- facebook for viewing what friends & family have uploaded: vacation pictures, informative videos
- comments on posts, usually due to social obligation, but also feels good to respond, sense of connection with people, especially abroad
- paraphrased: some of these people i haven't seen in years, but with their posts, it doesn't feel that long, like i'm still part of their lives
- also can talk (gossip lol) about people's posts with other people (her sister&friends)
    - my q: do you ever worry about people gossiping about you and your posts?
    - ans: no, i don't really post much, and what i do isn't anything bad (vacation location updates mainly, but nothing recently)
- convo about why she doesn't post much: people can easily find things "wrong" with your posts - location updates w/ certain people = a trip they weren't invited on; "suspicious" captions with images; pictures of events that they were not aware of
    - talked about a woman she knew that posted a family picture of them at a vacation spot, captioning it with something like "entire family"; some far away relative of hers got offended and commented about "apparently not being a part of her family anymore"; anyways, it was a mess, and my interviewee always remembers this, and so she doesn't post much at all, just sends images to family diectly
    - but sometimes, not commentating on a post is seen as rude too, especially if everyone else involved has already commented, then it "doesn't look good" on you

**Summary:**

In my conversation with Interviewee A, we talked about her usuage of the Facebook app. She uses it to connect with friends and family, especially ones who are physically located far away. She feels more connected to them by liking and commenting on their posts and updates, even though she herself doesn't post much. When talking about why, she mentioned how people can easily misinterpret posts or take offence from them. 

A particularly interesting story she told me was about a woman she knew who posted a family picture with a caption mentioning how happy she was that "her entire family" was on vacation with her. Some relative of hers took offence at that post and left a rude comment about about how he wasn't invited, so he must not be a part of her family anyways. This ended up causing a lot of family and community drama for this woman, and my interviewee thinks of this story when hesitating to post.

So interestingly, my interviewee enjoys being able to interact with other people's posts, but she doesn't post anything of hers, so any feelings of connection might not be reciprocated. When I pointed out this contradiction, she simply said that her business was her own, and "these people who post want everyone to know what they're doing". As I explored this idea further, it seems like there's a preconceived idea that whoever posts online is required to deal with whatever comments come there way - and "if they didn't want unwelcomed comments, then they shouldn't post at all in the first place". 


<!-- ### Brief Interlude
Between these two interviews, I reflected upon the converstation with Interviewee A, and for the second interview, I added a few more topics I wanted to explore/lead to:
- Social Nicities - do you interact w other people's content? 
- Have you ever had long periods of time where you did not have access to social media? 
    - How did you feel about that? -->

### Interviewee B
- uses snapchat and tiktok
- uses snapchat to talk with friends and keep streaks
    - sending streaks is part of routine, some streaks are so long he doesn't want to break them
    - streaks allow him to remain in constant contact with people he hasn't seen irl in a while
    - some old classmate/friend deleted snapchat and so their streak broke and they've never spoken again
    - posts things he does/places he goes on his story - vacation photos, concerts, waffle mornings
- uses tiktok
    - gets sent and send interesting tiktoks to close friends
    - "needs it" in a way to keep up with memes and stuff - when he came back from a trip abroad w poor internet connection, his classmates referenced tiktoks and things he didn't really get
        - but it wasn't really that hard to overcome, since new stuff is always coming up anyways
    - also enjoys tiktok just to relax at the end of the day

**Summary**

My talk with Interviewee B yielded some interesting thoughts, especially since this conversation made me really feel the age difference between us. He's only 14, and obviously cares about what other people think, and I feel from my talk that this plays a big impact on his use of social media. For example, he keeps up with all his snapchat streaks, even if some are just a daily black screen. He feels that even just that helps him feel more connected ("its not that big of a deal to talk to them, since we send stuff to each other every day anyways") to the other user, despite the fact that they haven't actually talked in at least a year. 

Another example is how is keeps up with TikTok trends/audios, since they are referenced by his friends/classmates all the time. He talked about how after being abroad for three weeks without internet connection meant he "kind of had to catch up" with the references and other things he missed. I think it's very interesting how his generation seems to heavily rely on social media for trends or even the latest news.


## Design Oppurtunities

1. An Anonoumous App

    In this app, all users are anonomous, allowing for freedom from social nicities. All posts don't have a username associated with them, and neither do the comments under them. Studies have shown that being anonomous helps people speak up about sensitive topics a lot more, and this would allow users to connect with other people while not under the gaze of friends/family. From my first interview, this seems to be a way to share life updates while not having real-world impacts, in a way.

2. Likes Only

    In an attempt to prevent unwanted comments on posts, this app limits users to "like" other people's posts. (This could be expanded to only emoji reactions as well, rather than "likes" specifically.) This would allow users to feel connected with each other, being able to see life updates and other content, without posters having to faciliate comments.

3. TalkChat

    Rather than just sending black screens to people on the daily, this app encourages you to actually talk to your friends. You can maintain a streak for how many days you've talked to a friend in a row, and the app gives you fun questions or prompts for you both to respond to, creating an even tighter bond in your friendship.
